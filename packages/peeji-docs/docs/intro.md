# Peeji

A pagination utility.

- 🤯 **Headless** - Peeji is a utility that returns an object with the pagination data. It doesn't render anything.
- 🤏 **Ellipsis**: Includes an ellipsis object, but only if it covers a gap of more
  than 2 pages.
- ⏭️ **First/last**: Always render the first and last page.
- ⏩ **Next/previous**: Render a customizable amount of pages before and after
  the current page.
- 🔁 **Consistent**: preserves the amount of items in the list.

## Installation

```bash
npm install peeji
```
